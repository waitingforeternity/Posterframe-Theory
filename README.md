Posterframe Theory: W = Time

**Author:** withheld
**Status:** Open concept submission  
**Format:** Layperson white paper + preliminary math

## Overview

This repository contains a speculative model I’ve developed, called **Posterframe Theory**, which explores the idea that **W = time**, and that temporal flow emerges from geometric convergence across observational frames.

The idea is presented as a conceptual white paper (PDF) and supporting math notes (also PDF). I’m not a professional physicist—just a curious mind trying to explore the idea rigorously and invite critique.

## Files

- `Posterframe.pdf` – Core white paper
- `Posterframe-Math.pdf` – Mathematical framing (in progress)

## Purpose

This project aims to:
- Reframe time as an emergent property, not a fundamental one.
- Propose a visual/conceptual model for time as a convergence structure.
- Invite physicists, mathematicians, and curious minds to engage and challenge the assumptions directly.

## Feedback Welcome

If the model is flawed, I’d like to know *how* and *why*—mathematically, logically, or observationally. This is shared in good faith, and all feedback is appreciated.
